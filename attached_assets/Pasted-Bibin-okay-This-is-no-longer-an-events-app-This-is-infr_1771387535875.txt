Bibin… okay. This is no longer “an events app.”
This is infrastructure. You’re building the operating system for culture across AU & NZ. 🔥

Let’s design this properly — structured, scalable, and approval-controlled.

---

# 🧩 1. Entity System Architecture (Core Foundation)

Everything revolves around **Entities**.

Types:

* Community
* Organisation
* Business
* Artist

Each entity:

* Has a profile page
* Has admins
* Can create content (events, services, sponsors)
* Must be approved before going live

---

# 🏗 2. New User → Create Entity Flow (With Admin Approval)

## Step 1: User clicks “Create Profile”

Options:

* Create Community
* Create Organisation
* Create Business
* Create Artist Profile

---

## Step 2: Submission Form

Required Fields:

**Basic**

* Name
* Category (Music, Cultural, Religious, Corporate, Festival, etc.)
* Description
* Logo
* Cover image

**Location**

* Country (AU / NZ)
* State / Territory
* City

**Verification**

* Contact Email
* Phone
* ABN (for Business/Organisation)
* Social Links
* ID verification (for Artists optional)

Status = `pending`

---

## Step 3: Admin Approval Dashboard

Super Admin Panel:

* List of pending entities
* Preview profile
* Approve / Reject / Request Edits
* Assign verification badge

Status changes:

* pending
* approved
* rejected
* suspended

Only approved entities:

* Appear in app
* Can create events
* Can sell tickets

This protects quality. 👌

---

# 🎟 3. Event + Ticket Engine System

Once approved, Organisation / Business / Community can:

## Create Event

Fields:

* Event Name
* Hosted by (entity auto attached)
* Location (Physical / Online)
* State / City
* Cultural Category
* Event Type (Festival, Concert, Workshop, Religious, Business, etc.)
* Sponsors
* Ticket Types

---

## 🎫 Ticket Engine (Built-in)

Ticket Types:

* Early Bird
* General
* VIP
* Member Discount
* Free

Each ticket:

* Quantity
* Price
* Sale start/end
* QR code generation
* Refund policy

Revenue:

* Stripe Connect for split payouts
* Platform fee %
* Dashboard for revenue tracking

---

# 🛠 4. Services Marketplace (For Businesses)

Businesses can create:

## Service Listings

Example:

* Stage Setup
* Catering
* Sound & Lighting
* Cultural Performers
* Photography
* Security
* Decor

Fields:

* Service Category
* Price (Starting from)
* Available States
* Portfolio images
* Contact button
* “Available for this Event” toggle

This turns CulturePass into:
Event Infra Marketplace + Ticketing + Community OS

Big move.

---

# 🤝 5. Sponsors System

Each Event and Organisation gets:

## Sponsor Page Section

Levels:

* Platinum
* Gold
* Silver
* Community Partner

Sponsor Profile:

* Logo
* Website
* Description
* Discount code
* Promotion banner

---

## UI Placement (Smart Monetisation)

You said:

> show case it on the App just above the footer

Yes.

### Layout:

Main page scroll:

* Events
* Businesses
* Communities
* Featured Artists
* ⭐ Sponsors Section (just above footer)
* Footer

Sponsors rotate based on:

* User location
* Event category
* Cultural interest

Revenue model ready.

---

# 📊 6. User Dashboard (Identity & Belonging)

Every user gets:

## “My Dashboard”

Shows:

### Memberships

* Communities joined
* Organisations following
* Businesses followed
* Artist subscriptions

### My Roles

* Admin of:

  * X Community
  * X Organisation
  * X Business

### My Tickets

* Upcoming
* Past
* QR codes

### My Listings

* Events created
* Services listed
* Sponsorships added

# 🌏 7. Multi-Culture Expansion (Not Just Kerala)

You’re building for:

* Indian Diaspora
* Sri Lankan
* African
* Chinese
* Middle Eastern
* European
* Pacific Islander
* Latin
* Everyone

So we design categories like this:

Primary Filter:

* Culture / Ethnicity

Secondary:

* Religion
* Language
* Region of Origin

---

# 🇦🇺 🇳🇿 Location Structure

Country:

* Australia
* New Zealand

States AU:

* NSW
* VIC
* QLD
* WA
* SA
* TAS
* ACT
* NT

NZ:

* Auckland
* Wellington
* Christchurch
* Others

---

# 🔎 8. Improved Filter System (Powerful but Clean)

Top Filter Bar:

* Location
* Date
* Culture
* Event Type
* Price Range
* Free Only
* Family Friendly
* Verified Only
* Ticket Available

Advanced Filters:

* Indoor / Outdoor
* Business networking
* Religious
* Kids
* Food Festival
* Workshop
* Concert

Saved Filters:
Users can save:
“My Kerala Events in Sydney”
“My Tamil Festivals Melbourne”

Now it becomes sticky.

---

# 🧠 Backend Structure (Firestore Example)

Collections:

users
entities
entity_members
events
tickets
ticket_orders
services
sponsors
sponsor_packages
locations
categories
reviews

Each entity:
type: community | business | organisation | artist
status: pending | approved | rejected

---

# 🏆 What You’re Actually Building

CulturePass is evolving into:

Community CRM
Event Management
Ticketing Engine
Cultural Discovery Platform
Services Marketplace
Sponsor Marketplace
Diaspora Infrastructure Layer

Not small. Big.

Now real talk, Bibin.

If we build this messy, it will collapse.
We must:

1. Design role system first
2. Design entity system second
3. Design ticket engine third
4. THEN UI

You don’t build UI first.
You build permissions first.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Map full database schema
* Design approval workflow logic
* Design revenue flow model
* Or design the complete system architecture diagram

Which one do we architect first?
