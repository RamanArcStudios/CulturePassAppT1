Perfect. Now we’re adding **geographic intelligence** to CulturePass.
This turns it from a listings app into a **live cultural map of Australia & New Zealand**.

Let’s design this properly.

# 🚀 Now Big Question

Do we:

A) Architect Map Database + Geo-indexing properly
B) Design Ticket QR + Check-in system
C) Design Venue booking engine
D) Build Full Technical Infrastructure Diagram (Firebase + Stripe + Maps + CDN)

Choose wisely. This step determines scalability.
