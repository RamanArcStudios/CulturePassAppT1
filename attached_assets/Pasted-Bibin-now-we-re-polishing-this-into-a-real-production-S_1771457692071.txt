Bibin — now we’re polishing this into a **real production SaaS ready for AU + NZ scale**.

I’ll structure this cleanly for Replit + App Store + Stripe compliance.

We’re upgrading:

* Clickable Maps
* QR Ticket + Check-in Engine
* Universal Share System
* Business Filters
* Platform Improvements
* App Store Payment Strategy (very important)
* Production Readiness Checklist

Let’s go.

---

# 🗺 1️⃣ Clickable Map + Directions (Production Ready)

Every entity, event, venue, business must include:

### Required Location Fields

* Venue Name
* Address Line
* City
* State
* Country
* Postcode
* Latitude
* Longitude

Store lat/lng in DB for performance.

---

## In App UI

Show embedded map preview using:

* Google Maps JS SDK (Web)
* Apple MapKit (iOS)
* Google Maps SDK (Android)

---

## On Click → Open Native Maps App

### For iOS:

```
http://maps.apple.com/?daddr=LAT,LNG
```

### For Android:

```
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=LAT,LNG
```

### Web fallback:

Open Google Maps in new tab.

This dramatically improves UX and trust.

# 🎟 2️⃣ QR Code Ticket System + Check-In

This must be secure.

---

## Ticket Creation Flow

When ticket purchased:

1. Create order
2. Generate unique ticket ID (UUID)
3. Generate signed token
4. Create QR code containing:

```
culturepass.com/checkin/{signed_ticket_token}
```

---

## QR Code Generation (Server)

Use:

```
qrcode npm package
```

Generate as:

* PNG for email
* SVG for in-app display

---

## Check-In Flow

Event Manager:

* Opens Check-In dashboard
* Scans QR using device camera
* Backend validates:

✔ Ticket exists
✔ Not already checked in
✔ Event matches
✔ Not refunded

Mark:

```
checked_in = true
checked_in_at = timestamp
```

---

## Fraud Prevention

* Signed tokens (JWT with short expiration)
* QR regenerates if user refreshes
* Offline fallback mode with local cache

---

# 🔁 3️⃣ Universal Share System (Everywhere)

Users must be able to share:

* Events
* Communities
* Businesses
* Organisations
* Artists
* Services
* Perks
* Venues

---

## Sharing Methods

* Native Share (Web Share API)
* Copy link
* WhatsApp
* Instagram (deep link)
* Facebook
* X
* Email

---

## Deep Linking Structure

```
culturepass.com/event/{slug}
culturepass.com/business/{slug}
culturepass.com/community/{slug}
```

App handles:

* If app installed → open in app
* If not → open web

---

# 🏢 4️⃣ Business Filters (Advanced & Smart)

Add filters specifically for Businesses:

Top Filters:

* Service Category
* Location
* Available for Events
* Price Range
* Verified Only
* Rating
* Cultural Specialty

Advanced:

* Wedding Specialists
* Corporate Events
* Religious Events
* Kids Events
* Festival Experience
* Equipment Rental
* Catering Type (Veg, Halal, etc.)

Add:
“Available This Month” toggle.

Now it becomes a real event marketplace.

---

# 📊 5️⃣ Additional Improvements You Missed (Upgrades)

## A. Venue Profiles (New Entity Type)

Venues can:

* List capacity
* Upload seating plan
* Add accessibility info
* Show parking details

Huge opportunity.

---

## B. Reviews System

Allow:

* Event reviews
* Business reviews
* Venue reviews

Moderated by SuperAdmin.

---

## C. Smart Recommendations Engine

Based on:

* Culture selected
* Location
* Past tickets
* Communities joined

Use simple scoring algorithm first.

---

## D. Event Reminder Automation

Push:

* 7 days before
* 1 day before
* 2 hours before

---

## E. Waitlist System

If event sold out:
User joins waitlist.
If refund → auto notify.

---

# 🍏 6️⃣ IMPORTANT: In-App Ticket Purchase Without Paying Apple 30%

Critical.

Apple rule:

If you sell digital goods consumed inside app → Apple requires IAP.

BUT.

Event tickets for real-world events = **Physical goods/services**.

Stripe checkout is allowed.

You CAN use Stripe inside app without Apple taking 30%.

Do NOT:

* Sell digital memberships through Stripe in iOS
* Sell virtual-only content

Keep tickets strictly real-world.

You’re safe.
