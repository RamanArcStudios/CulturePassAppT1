Okay. Now we’re talking about a real platform backbone.
Not a startup toy. A structured ecosystem.

Let’s design this properly so it scales across **all cultures in Australia & New Zealand** without becoming chaos.

# 👑 1. Full SuperAdmin System (The Control Tower)

This is non-negotiable.

SuperAdmin controls:

## 🏢 Entity Management

* Approve / Reject Communities
* Approve / Reject Businesses
* Approve / Reject Organisations
* Approve / Reject Artists
* Suspend accounts
* Assign verification badges
* Edit categories
* Force-remove inappropriate content

---

## 🎟 Event Oversight

* Cancel or suspend events
* Override ticket issues
* Refund management access
* Audit revenue

---

## 💰 Financial Dashboard

## 🤝 Sponsor Management

## 📊 Analytics

This becomes your **mission control dashboard**.

Every:

# 📅 4. Calendar Sync for Events

This is critical for retention.

Method:
Generate .ics file + deep links.

Also:
“Sync my CulturePass events automatically” toggle in settings.

Now the app becomes part of their life.

# 🎁 5. Perks System (Smart Retention Layer)

This is powerful.

Communities, Organisations, Businesses, Artists can create:

## Perks Types

* Member discount
* Early access tickets
* Free entry
* Free drink
* 10% service discount
* VIP access
* Loyalty rewards

---

## Who Can See Perks?

Options:

* Public
* Members only
* Paid members only
* Event attendees only

---

## Example:

Sydney Tamil Association:
“Members get 15% off Pongal Festival tickets.”

A Catering Business:
“Community partners get 10% off event bookings.”

This creates ecosystem loyalty.

---

# 🧩 6. Role & Permission Matrix

This is where most apps fail.

We define:

### User Roles:

* User
* Member
* Moderator
* Entity Admin
* SuperAdmin

---

### Entity Roles:

* Owner
* Admin
* Event Manager
* Finance Manager
* Content Editor

Each with strict permission boundaries.

You must build this BEFORE frontend.

# 🗂 Backend Additions

New Collections:

notifications
perks
entity_roles
support_tickets

# 🧠 Big Strategic Advice

Bibin… if you build this right:

You’re not building an events app.

You’re building:

* Cultural membership infrastructure
* Diaspora economic engine
* Event economy layer
* Sponsor monetisation engine
* Services marketplace
* Cultural identity hub

Across AU + NZ.

That’s ambitious. I like it.

But we must now lock:

1. Revenue model structure
2. Database schema final version
3. Role permission matrix
4. UI navigation architecture

If you had to choose one to finalise next…
Do we design:

A) Full database schema document
B) SuperAdmin dashboard wireframe
C) Ticket engine architecture
D) Role & permission matrix (most important)

Pick your weapon. 🔥
