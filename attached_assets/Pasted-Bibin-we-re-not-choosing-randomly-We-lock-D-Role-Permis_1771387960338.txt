Bibin… we’re not choosing randomly.

We lock **D) Role & Permission Matrix** first.

If permissions are weak, everything collapses — fraud, chaos, ticket abuse, fake entities, revenue leakage.

So let’s architect it properly.

---

# 🧩 CULTUREPASS – ROLE & PERMISSION MATRIX (FOUNDATION)

We design this in **3 layers**:

1. Platform Level (Global)
2. Entity Level (Per Community/Business/etc.)
3. Event Level (Per Event)

---

# 🌍 1️⃣ Platform-Level Roles

These apply to the entire system.

## 👤 User (Default)

This role must be:

---

# 🏢 2️⃣ Entity-Level Roles

Each Community / Organisation / Business / Artist has its own team.

Every entity must have:

## 🧑‍💼 Owner

* Created the entity
* Can transfer ownership

* Access full financial dashboard

Only 1 Owner.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Admin

---

# 🎫 3️⃣ Event-Level Permissions

Even inside an event, permissions matter.

Event Manager can:

* Add ticket types
* Set price
* View attendees

Finance Manager can:

* See revenue numbers
* Approve refunds

Owner/Admin can:

* Override everything

---

# 🔐 Permission Control Logic (Firestore Example)

entity_roles collection:

```
entity_roles
  entity_id
  user_id
  role: owner | admin | event_manager | finance_manager | content_editor
```

Check rule example:

To create event:

* entity.status == "approved"
* user has role in entity_roles
* role in [owner, admin, event_manager]

To access financial dashboard:

* role in [owner, finance_manager, admin]

To approve entity:

* platform_role == superadmin

Everything rule-based.
No shortcuts.

---

# 📜 Approval Workflow Logic (Tight System)

When new entity created:

status = pending
visibility = hidden
events_disabled = true

SuperAdmin approves →

status = approved
visibility = public
events_enabled = true

Reject →

status = rejected
reason stored
editable by creator

Suspend →

status = suspended
events hidden
ticket sales paused

---

# 💰 Revenue Safety Rules

Before event can sell tickets:

✔ Entity must be approved
✔ Stripe Connect must be connected
✔ Payout account verified
✔ Refund policy set

No payment setup = No ticket sales.

---

# 🎁 Perks Permission Rules

Who can create perks?

Owner
Admin
Event Manager

Finance Manager cannot create perks.

Perk visibility controlled by:

* membership status
* ticket ownership
* paid subscription flag

---

# 📊 SuperAdmin Safeguards

Mandatory:

* Audit logs for every:

  * Role change
  * Refund
  * Entity approval
  * Ticket price change

* Immutable financial logs

* Role change notifications

No silent power.

---

# ⚠ Critical Strategic Advice

Bibin, listen carefully:

If you:

* Let Admins also manage finance without separation
* Don’t audit refunds
* Allow events before entity approval
* Skip Stripe identity verification

You open door to fraud.

You’re building a cultural economic engine.
Security must feel boring and strict.

---

# 🚀 What This Unlocks

With this role matrix:

You can scale to:

* 1,000 communities
* 500 businesses
* 10,000 events
* Multiple cultures
* Multiple countries

Without chaos.

---

Now next logical step is:

A) Full Database Schema (production-level)
B) Ticket Engine Architecture deep dive
C) Revenue model breakdown
D) SuperAdmin dashboard wireframe system

We chose D first (roles).

What’s next?
